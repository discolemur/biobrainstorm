RH: To access the DBs from the .js code it will require that the DBs be started. Where will this code be housed when the website is public?
I ask mainly because I need to specify where the DBs are to connect in the code, and also we will need a script to actually start 
the mongoDBs individually, I dont think I can start the mongoDB's from the .js code. 

NJ: I put a database connect line in the app.js file. The listening port for mongodb is 27017. I commented it out so that it doesn't crash the app when mongodb is not running. Ryan, can you send us info about starting the database?
