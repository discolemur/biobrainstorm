RH: To access the DBs from the .js code it will require that the DBs be started. Where will this code be housed when the website is public?
I ask mainly because I need to specify where the DBs are to connect in the code, and also we will need a script to actually start 
the mongoDBs individually, I dont think I can start the mongoDB's from the .js code. 

Taylin: I would think the mongodb would be running on the same server that our website is running. Unless we wanted to have 2 servers.
One that handled all of our web requests and another that ran our mongodb. Our first server could then connect to the second whenever it
needed to interact with it. Just to be sure though you mean in order to to start the DB you have to enter mongod into a terminal and usually you cant do that in 
node? I found a few lines that will do that for you.

var sys = require('sys')
var exec = require('child_process').exec;
var child = exec("mongod",function(error, stdout, stderr){
        if (error!== null){
                console.log('exec error: ' + error);
        }
});

if you add that to the begining of your mongoDBmongoose.js it will call mongod from the terminal

NJ:  I put a database connect line in the app.js file. The listening port for mongodb is 27017. I commented it out so that it doesn't crash the app when mongodb is not running. Ryan, can you send us info about starting the database?
